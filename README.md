Executive Summary
This capstone project will look at military veteran population demographics broken down in various categories, such as: ethnicity, sex, age group, rank, state and county locations, branch of service, rank, era of armed conflict, and veteransâ€™ utilization of a Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN).
Motivation
As a veteran myself and having two brothers and a sister who are also veterans, it interests me to find and visualize trends and insights of the veteran population.
Data Question
Present your question. Feel free to include any research/articles that are relevant or show where others have attempted to answer this question.

What is the correlation between the different variables of the dataset? What differences are there in demographics between each era of armed conflict?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Identify population trends from state to state, or county to county of veterans. Identify areas where certain ranks and branches of service tend to reside after the military.

Known Issues and Challenges
Current data is very bare-bones between the 11 csv files. Conclusions and assumptions might be hard to reach without additional data.
